### Key React Concept: Writing a React component

There are three main steps to writing a React component:

1. Import React from the 'react' package, so that you can use JSX inside your .js file.
2. Define your component. It should be a function that returns a JSX element.
3. Export your component, so that it can be used by other parts of your site.

Your component must return a single React element, but you can put as many elements inside that top-level element as you want.
