### Key Gatsby Concept: General process for using data in your site

1. Add a source plugin to add data into the GraphQL data layer.
2. Use GraphiQL to design a query that responds with the data you want from the data layer.
3. Add the query into your component.
    Use page queries for page components.
    Use useStaticQuery for “building block” components.
4. Use the data from the response in your component.
